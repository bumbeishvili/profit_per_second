Ever wonder how much the richest companies in the world make... by the second? Well, TitleMax (not sure why) collected the data and presenteded it in an interesting infographic. 

Why the funny way of aggregating the data? The truth is that these companies just make too much freaking money for us to wrap our meager minds around. Apple makes $586 more per second then the median American makes in a week. Consider this article a solution to mentally scalling the data to aid interpretation.

What can we do to make this data more presentable?

#### What works well
* I like how TitleMax has taken an unfathomably large number and boiled it down into something much more manageble, profit per second.
* They have certainly fit a lot into a little space

#### What could be improved
* We could make the message more clear by cleaning up the space.
* Maybe we can add some animation to increate engagment and the story of how much money these megacompanies make in a minute.

### What I did

I was swimming in the deep end this week. I honestly didn't want to try and develop D3 maps so soon, but this dataset needs a map. So, I went to with a globe to show a more honest representation of the land covered. I also allowed users to select with bird they would like to track.

## Acknowledgments

This project would be what it is without the efforts of [Andy Kriebel](https://twitter.com/VizWizBI) and [Eva Murray](https://twitter.com/TriMyData), so be sure to give a shout out.

I depended in the D3 community more than ever this week. The dataset and what I was trying to accomplish was very difficult for me. If you're working with D3 I can't recommend joining the [Slack](https://d3-slackin.herokuapp.com/) channel enough. I asked them countless questions.
